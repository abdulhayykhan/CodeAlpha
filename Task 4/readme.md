# 💬 Task 4 – Basic Chatbot

This task implements a simple **rule-based chatbot** using Python.  
The chatbot responds to predefined user inputs like greetings, questions, and farewells, demonstrating core Python logic and interaction flow.

---

## ✅ Features

- Interacts with the user via the console
- Responds to basic phrases like:
  - `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"what's your name"`, `"bye"`
- Includes default fallback for unrecognized inputs
- Loops until the user says `"bye"` or `"exit"`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `functions` to organize chatbot logic
- `if-elif-else` for rule-based decision making
- `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
- String handling (`.lower()` for case insensitivity)
- Loops (`while True`) with exit condition

---

## 🧪 Logic Overview

- The chatbot accepts a user message as input
- It checks the message against predefined conditions
- If it matches, a corresponding reply is printed
- If the input is unknown, a default message is shown
- The loop continues until the user types `"bye"` or `"exit"`

---

## 📸 Example Interaction

- 💬 Welcome to the Python Chatbot!
- Type 'bye' or 'exit' to end the chat.

- You: hello
- Bot: Hi there! 👋

- You: how are you
- Bot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing fine! 😄

- You: what's your name
- Bot: I'm a simple Python chatbot created by you!

- You: goodbye
- Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day! 👋
