**Concepts Used:** `regex`, `file reading/writing`, `try-except`, `string processing`  
- Scans a `.txt` file and extracts all valid email addresses.
- Saves the found emails to a new output file.
- Demonstrates a real-world automation use case.


### 🔹 Task 4 – Basic Chatbot
**File:** `task4_BasicChatbot.py`  
**Concepts Used:** `functions`, `if-elif`, `loops`, `input/output`
