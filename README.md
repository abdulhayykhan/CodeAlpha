## ✅ Task Details

### 🔹 Task 1 – Hangman Game
**File:** `task1_HangmanGame.py`  
**Concepts Used:** `random`, `loops`, `if-else`, `strings`, `lists`, input/output

**File:** `task2_StockPortfolioTracker.py`  
**Concepts Used:** `dictionary`, `input/output`, `arithmetic`, `file handling`  
- User enters stock names and quantities.
- The program uses hardcoded prices to calculate total investment.
- Optionally saves the result to a `.txt` file.


### 🔹 Task 3 – Task Automation (Email Extractor)
**File:** `task3_TaskAutomation.py`  
**Concepts Used:** `regex`, `file reading/writing`, `try-except`, `string processing`  
- Scans a `.txt` file and extracts all valid email addresses.
- Saves the found emails to a new output file.
- Demonstrates a real-world automation use case.


### 🔹 Task 4 – Basic Chatbot
**File:** `task4_BasicChatbot.py`  
**Concepts Used:** `functions`, `if-elif`, `loops`, `input/output`  
- Accepts simple inputs like "hello", "how are you", "bye".
